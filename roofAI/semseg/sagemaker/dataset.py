    Let us now upload our prepared datset to the S3 bucket that we decided to use in this notebook 
    earlier. Notice the following directory structure that is used.

    ```bash
    root 
    |-train/
    |-train_annotation/
    |-validation/
    |-validation_annotation/

    ```

    Notice also that all the images in the `_annotation` directory are all indexed PNG files. This 
    implies that the metadata (color mapping modes) of the files contain information on how to map 
    the indices to colors and vice versa. Having an indexed PNG is an advantage as the images will 
    be rendered by image viewers as color images, but the image themsevels only contain integers. 
    The integers are also within `[0, 1 ... c-1, 255]`  for a `c` class segmentation problem, with 
    `255` as 'hole' or 'ignore' class. We allow any mode that is a 
    [recognized standard](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.x/handbook/concepts.html#concept-modes) 
    as long as they are read as integers.

    While we recommend the format with default color mapping modes such as PASCAL, the algorithm also 
    allows users to specify their own label maps. Refer to the 
    [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/semantic-segmentation.html#semantic-segmentation-inputoutput) 
    for more details. The label map for the PASCAL VOC dataset is the default, which is equivalent to:

    ```json
    {
        "scale": 1
    }
    ```

    This essentially tells the algorithm to directly use the image pixel value integers as labels. 
    Since we are using PASCAL dataset, let us create (recreate the default just for demonstration) a 
    label map for training channel and let the algorithm use the default (which is exactly the same)
    for the validation channel. If `label_map` is used, please pass it to the label_map channel.
