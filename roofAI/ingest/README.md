Files are in `./SegNet-Tutorial/CamVid/`, where, for `subset` in `[test, train, val]`,

- `{subset}/` contains `.png`s: RGB. 
- `{subset}annot/` contains `.png`s: RGB, three channels identical, `0-11` corresponding to the following classes. `Dataset` filters the required `classes` for a train.
```python
CLASSES = [
    "sky",
    "building",
    "pole",
    "road",
    "pavement",
    "tree",
    "signsymbol",
    "fence",
    "car",
    "pedestrian",
    "bicyclist",
    "unlabelled",
]
```
- `{subset}.txt` is likely unused.
